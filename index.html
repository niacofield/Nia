      Who's Nia? Ha, that's me! I'm sixteen and in tenth grade, and some things to summarize me...I'm a soccer player, an actor, a writer, lover of shopping, and a playwriter;) 
You can learn even more about me by clicking the "About Moi" link. Definitely look at that one. Next to that is the "Hobbies" link. There I go into detail about the plays I've participated in, my years of playing soccer, etc.
And lastly, writing is one of my favorite things to do. So under the "Popular Stories Written my Moi" link, you can discover some of the books and novels that I've created. Many of them are based off fandoms,
especially the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
